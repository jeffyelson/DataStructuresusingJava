algorithm:
Algorithm is a step by step procedure for a given process. The step by step procedure of picking two random candies from the bowl and eating them if it is both red or putting the blue back if both are not red is an algorithm.

termination:
Termination is the end point of the process where the progress of the process comes to a halt. In the case of the candy, the process would reach termination when there is only one candy in the bowl. 

deterministic process:
Deterministic process is a process where there is no randomness of the future result. Here, the colour of the candies to be picked cannot be determined as there is randomness in picking the same from the bowl. Therefore the process is not deterministic.  

deterministic result:
Deterministic result is when the final outcome can be estimated without any randomness. Here, if the number of
number of blue candies are odd then one candy would remain otherwise none would remain in the bowl.
